# Smallblog template

This is the default [Smallblog](https://github.com/tayzendev/smallblog) template.

If you are using [Smallweb](https://github.com/pomdtr/smallweb), just use this integrated command, and you're good to go: `smallweb create --template=github.com/tayzendev/smallblog-template blog`.

If you are not (yet!) using Smallweb, you can clone this repository or read the [Smallblog documentation](https://github.com/tayzendev/smallblog) for more installation methods.
